# Python Basics
## Basic Python programs for NEW learners
### **NOTE : Pojects are coded using Visual studio, thus have a .sln file. for any other Python IDEs, use the .py file only.

Python code is not compiled, It is interpreted.
Therefore, it can be executed directly on any IDE.

Here, you'll discover a collection of fundamental Python programs that form the building blocks of coding. From simple data manipulation to introductory algorithms, each program is designed to help beginners grasp key concepts while providing a stepping stone for more advanced projects. Join me on this coding journey as we explore the versatile world of Python together. Whether you're a newcomer or just looking to brush up on the basics, there's something here for everyone. Happy coding!

The above Python code is written in Python 3.
